# Best practices from the field: Build dynamic collections for Microsoft 365 Apps with Configuration Manager

> [!NOTE]
> This article was written by Microsoft experts in the field who work with enterprise customers to deploy Office.

As an admin, you often must manage more than one [update channel](../overview-update-channels.md) for the Microsoft 365 Apps in your organization. Or you may be planning to move devices to a new channel and need a way to see and manage devices by channel with minimal management overhead and effort. This article will show you how to implement [dynamic collections](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/core/clients/manage/collections/create-collections) in Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager to achieve the following goals:
- Set up collections that will automatically add/remove devices based on the installed update channel.
- Set up a collection that will automatically add all devices running Microsoft 365 Apps for easier update targeting.
- Set up a collection that will hold all devices on update channels that you as IT don't support in your environment.

For dynamic collections, Configuration Manager automatically evaluates the membership of devices based on rules and queries. So no manual work is required required to keep these collections up to date.
Such an implementation will enable you to:
- Easily identify and target devices based on their currently installed update channel.
- When devices switch update channels, you can easily check progress just by looking at the number of devices per collection.
- Identify devices that are on undesired update channels and implement actions to correct the configuration drift.
- Reduce admin effort by targeting the right set of devices with updates automatically.

This article provides an example as well as step-by-step instructions to set up dynamic collections.

## Example

Letâ€™s assume your organization has deployed Microsoft 365 Apps to several thousand devices. You run a mix of [Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel (Preview)](../overview-update-channels.md#preview-upcoming-new-features-of-semi-annual-enterprise-channel) (SAEC-P) and [Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel](../overview-update-channels.md#semi-annual-enterprise-channel-overview) (SAEC), and you want to adopt the recently introduced [Monthly Enterprise Channel](../overview-update-channels.md#monthly-enterprise-channel-overview) (MEC). A few devices in your environment run Current Channel, even though it's not supported by your IT department.

In this scenario, we would implement five dynamic collections in Configuration Manager:
- Three collections to add devices as members when the device is running a specific update channel, one each for SAEC-P, SAEC, and MEC.
- One collection to catch all devices running Microsoft 365 Apps to make deploying updates for all update channels easier. Devices will download matching updates only.
- One collection to capture devices running any update channel other than the three that are supported by the IT department.

We'll use these collections to deploy Configuration Manager applications and updates:
- To the SAEC and SAEC-P collections, we can deploy applications that will trigger a channel change to MEC. Once the channel change has been done, devices will automatically leave the old collection and get added to the MEC collection.
- The collection that catches all Microsoft 365 App installations can be used to deploy updates for all supported channels. Configuration Manager will deem updates that don't match the update channel of the device as not applicable, so devices will only download matching updates. Devices that are about to change the channel will be able to perform the required update to the new channel as well automatically.
- The collection that catches devices with a configuration drift can be used to force such devices back to update channels supported by IT.

## Implement collections that catch devices on a certain update channel

Follow these steps to create a dynamic collection that will add devices based on a specific, installed update channel. After it's set up, devices will be dropped and added automatically. This enables you to see/target all devices on a certain channel easily.

1. Navigate to **Assets and Compliance**, select **Device Collections** and then **Create Device Collection** on the **Home** menu.
2. Provide a name and select a limiting collection. Select **Next**.
3. Select **Add Rule** and choose **Query Rule**. Provide a **Name** and select **Edit Query Statement**. Then select **Show Query Language**.
4. Paste the following text into the editor window.
```sql
select * from SMS_R_System inner join SMS_G_System_OFFICE365PROPLUSCONFIGURATIONS on SMS_G_System_OFFICE365PROPLUSCONFIGURATIONS.ResourceId = SMS_R_System.ResourceId where SMS_G_System_OFFICE365PROPLUSCONFIGURATIONS.cfgUpdateChannel = "ReplaceThis"
```
> [!NOTE]
> The query is provided as-is and is based on engagements in the field.
5. Replace the string **ReplaceThis** with the matching update channel value for the channel you want to capture in this collection from the following table:

|Update channel                           |Update channel value                                                  |
|:----------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Beta Channel                             |http://officecdn.microsoft.com/pr/5440fd1f-7ecb-4221-8110-145efaa6372f|
|Current Channel (Preview)                |http://officecdn.microsoft.com/pr/64256afe-f5d9-4f86-8936-8840a6a4f5be|
|Current Channel                          |http://officecdn.microsoft.com/pr/492350f6-3a01-4f97-b9c0-c7c6ddf67d60|
|Monthly Enterprise Channel               |http://officecdn.microsoft.com/pr/55336b82-a18d-4dd6-b5f6-9e5095c314a6|
|Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel (Preview) |http://officecdn.microsoft.com/pr/b8f9b850-328d-4355-9145-c59439a0c4cf|
|Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel           |http://officecdn.microsoft.com/pr/7ffbc6bf-bc32-4f92-8982-f9dd17fd3114|

The final query should look similar to the following screenshot. Make sure to keep the quotation marks.

7. Select **OK** and then **OK** again. We recommend that you select the incremental updates check box, but this is optional.
8. Select **Summary**, **Next**, and then **Close** to complete the wizard.

Repeat these steps for each update channel that you want to be captured in a separate collection. The result will look like this:

## Implement a collection that catches all devices running Microsoft 365 Apps

Follow these steps to create a dynamic collection that will add all devices with Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise installed. After it's set up, devices will be dropped and added automatically. This enables you to target Microsoft 365 Apps client updates easily.

1. Navigate to **Assets and Compliance**, select **Device Collections** and **Create Device Collection** button on the **Home** menu.
2. Provide a name and select a limiting collection. Click **Next**.
3. Select **Add Rule** and choose **Query Rule**. Provide a **Name** and select **Edit Query Statement**. Then select **Show Query Language**.
4. Paste the following text into the editor window.

```sql
select SMS_R_System.ResourceId, SMS_R_System.ResourceType, SMS_R_System.Name, SMS_R_System.SMSUniqueIdentifier, SMS_R_System.ResourceDomainORWorkgroup, SMS_R_System.Client from  SMS_R_System inner join SMS_G_System_OFFICE_PRODUCTINFO on SMS_G_System_OFFICE_PRODUCTINFO.ResourceID = SMS_R_System.ResourceId where SMS_G_System_OFFICE_PRODUCTINFO.IsProPlusInstalled = 1
```
> [!NOTE]
>The query is provided as-is and based on engagements in the field. This query checks for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise. You might want to adjust the query for other licenses.

5. Click **OK**, **OK**. We recommend ticking the box for incremental updates, but this is optional.
6. Click **Summary**, **Next**, and then **Close** to complete the wizard.
The result is a collection that will automatically add all devices running Microsoft 365 Apps, regardless of the update channel.

## Implement a collection that catches all devices running other update channels

After you create collections for the updates channels that you're supporting as IT, you might also want to create one to catch all devices running other channels. This can help to find configuration drift and implement measures to re-establish the desired configuration on those devices.

1. Navigate to **Assets and Compliance**. Select **Device Collections** and **Create Device Collection** on the **Home** menu.
2. Provide a name and select a limiting collection. Select **Next**.
3. Select **Add Rule** and then **Include Collections**. Select the collection you created to catch all devices running Microsoft 365 Apps. Select **OK**.
4. Select **Add Rule** again and then **Select Exclude Collections**. Select the collections you created that catching devices on supported update channels. select **OK**.

![Screenshot from Configuration Manager showing the wizard to include and exclude collections with previously created collections](../images/fieldnotes_DynCollection_3.png)

5. Select **OK** again. We recommend that you select the incremental updates check box, but this is optional.
6. Select **Summary**, **Next**, and then **Close** to complete the wizard.

This collection will now automatically add all devices that have Microsoft 365 Apps installed but are not a member of one of the other collections that we created. As a result, the collection will catch all devices that are running on an update channel that you haven't created a separate collection for.

## Deploy applications and updates

Based on our example scenario, the next steps could be:
- Deploy an application that instructs the device to [perform a channel change](../change-update-channels.md#change-the-update-channel-with-configuration-manager) to Monthly Enterprise Channel as "available" to the collection that holds SAEC and SAEC-P devices. This enables users to switch the channel on their own terms and at their own pace. You'd see the devices transitioning to the new collection automatically.
- Deploy an application that allows a user to revert from, for example, Monthly Enterprise Channel to Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel in case there are any issues. If your devices are receiving updates from the Office CDN, you can use the same approach as described previously. If you manage updates using Configuration Manager, you must offer a re-install of the Microsoft 365 Apps to the users as Configuration Manager [can't perform a downgrade](../change-update-channels.md#considerations-when-changing-channels) when it comes to the installed build version.
- [Deploy updates](../manage-microsoft-365-apps-updates-configuration-manager.md) from all the update channels that you support to the collection that holds all devices running Microsoft 365 Apps. It's important to not deploy updates to the individual collections, because devices that are undergoing performing a channel change must have access to the target update to complete the transition. Devices will only download applicable updates. So if a device is offered SEAC, SAEC-P and MEC updates, it will only download the delta from the update channel that the device is currently on or is instructed to switch to. Updates from other channels will not be downloaded.
- Deploy an application that reinstalls the desired Microsoft 365 Apps configuration (for example, Monthly Enterprise Channel) to the collection that holds all devices that have configuration drift.

## Notes

- If the configuration of a device is changed, there are two timers that are relevant on the Configuration Manager side:
    - First, the device must upload the [Hardware Inventory](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/core/clients/manage/inventory/introduction-to-hardware-inventory.md), which includes the information about the selected update channel.
    - Second, the Configuration Manager infrastructure must recalculate the memberships of the collections.
- The term "update channel supported by IT" in this article refers to what the IT supports as an approved configuration in the organization. The created collection will not catch devices which are running an unsupported build of the Microsoft 365 Apps.
