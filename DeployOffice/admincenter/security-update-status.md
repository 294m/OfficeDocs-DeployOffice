# Overview of the security update status report in the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is pre-release documentation for a preview program that isn’t available to everyone and is subject to change.

Helping you to ensure devices are secure, compliant and up to date is a key part of the Apps admin center. To help with that, you can access a Security Update Status report. This gives you an insight into the security compliance state of Office devices in your enterprise in relation to the latest security patches available.

## Getting started

To access currency reports you need to be onboarded onto the apps admin center Inventory and have devices sending Inventory data.

> [!NOTE]
> You can learn more about [Onboarding to the Apps admin center inventory.](inventory.md)

Once you are successfully onboarded, to access the reports, use the left navigation, click on the health, then Security currency. This lands you on the Security currency dashboard.

## Report Dashboard

The landing page has several useful pieces of information to help you evaluate your security status for Office patches.

The first card is the update status card. This gives you the current snapshot of the status of your active devices. Your devices are evaluated against the latest release patch date  depending on the assigned channel and can be in 3 categories.

- Up to date – This is a device that has taken the [latest security patch](https://docs.microsoft.com/officeupdates/microsoft365-apps-security-updates)
- Not up to date – This is a device on a patch older than the most recent one.
- Unknown – A device where we failed to get information for.

You can also drill down into all devices on or view the devices that are not up to date.

The second is the goal card. This allows you to track your goals each month against the latest security patches that have been released. To set your goal, click on set a goal and a flyout will appear. This flyout lets you set a goal in the form of a percentage of devices you wish to take the device and the timeline in which you wish to hit that target. Once you save, the card will update to display your goals. You can modify these at any point after by repeating this process.
