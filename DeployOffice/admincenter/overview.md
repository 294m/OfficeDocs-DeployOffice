# Overview of the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center

The [Microsoft 365 Apps admin center](https://aka.ms/o365clientmgmt) provides modern management in the cloud for admins who  deploy and manage Microsoft 365 Apps in the enterprise. This article lists the features and services available in the admin center. For newly released or announced features, see [What's new in preview](#whats-new-in-preview).
 
## How to get to the admin center

Sign in at [config.office.com](https://config.office.com/) with your admin account. To sign into the admin center, your account must have either the global administrator, security administrator, or Office apps administrator role.

## Office cloud policy service

The Office cloud policy service lets you enforce policy settings for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise on a user's device, even if the device isn't domain joined or otherwise managed. When a user signs into Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise on a device, the policy settings roam to that device. You can also enforce some policy settings for Office for the web, both for users who are signed in and for users who access documents anonymously. 

For more information, see [Overview of the Office cloud policy service for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](../overview-office-cloud-policy-service.md).

## Security Policy Advisor

You can use Security Policy Advisor to receive and implement security policy recommendations. These recommendations are based on Microsoft best practices and information about your existing environment. 

For more information, see [Overview of Security Policy Advisor for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](../overview-of-security-policy-advisor.md).

## Office customization tool

The Office customization tool creates the configuration files that are used to deploy Office in large organizations. These configuration files give you more control over an Office installation: you can define which applications and languages are installed, how those applications should be updated, and application preferences. After creating the configuration files, you can use them with the [Office Deployment Tool](overview-office-deployment-tool.md) to deploy a customized version of Office. 

For more information, see [Overview of the Office Customization Tool](../overview-of-the-office-customization-tool-for-click-to-run.md).
