# Set a preference to prevent access to add-ins


If youâ€™re an admin, you may want to prevent Mac users from installing and running Office add-ins for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. To do that, you can use the following information to configure a policy:

|Category|Details|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Domain**  | com.microsoft.office  |
|**Key** |OfficeWebAddinDisableOMEXCatalog  |
|**Data type**|Boolean|
|**Possible values** <br/> |false  *(default)*  <br/> true |

Setting the key to `true` will also disable default add-ins including Wikipedia, Bing Maps, People Graph, and Microsoft Visio Data Visualizer. However, users will still be able to run admin-managed add-ins.

If you want to disable all add-ins from running, even add-ins that are admin-managed, configure the following policy:

|Category|Details|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Domain**  | com.microsoft.office  |
|**Key** |OfficeWebAddinDisableAllCatalogs  |
|**Data type**|Boolean|
|**Possible values** <br/> |false  *(default)*  <br/> true |

These policies are CFPreferences-compatible, which means that they can be set using enterprise management software for Mac, such as Jamf Pro.

> [!NOTE]
> The policies listed in this article do not affect Office add-ins in Microsoft Outlook for Mac.
